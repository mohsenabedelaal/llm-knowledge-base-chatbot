**RAG** is an architecture that combines the strengths of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. In a RAG system, when a query is received, relevant information is first retrieved from a knowledge base or document collection. This retrieved information is then provided as context to a language model, which uses it to generate a response. This approach allows the model to access up-to-date or specialized information that may not be part of its original training data, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and relevant answers. RAG architectures can help mitigate hallucinations in AI responses and allow for more controllable and verifiable outputs, as the generated content is grounded in specific, retrievable sources.
